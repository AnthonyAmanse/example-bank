#### Managing the growth of a digital idea

Many of the apps you use from your phone every day, although recognizable around the world, may be served from different clouds, or work different ways in other locals. Man years of effort have been shrunk down into a convenient little rectangle on your phone.

Behind the scenes, an initial concept, or feature can quickly turn into a diversified set of related apps, cooperating between different platforms, whether they be on premise, or on a selection of cloud vendors, runtimes and policies. 

It is an exciting, yet sometimes challenging landscape to work in, and is a fascinating emerging discipline for developers and operational teams. It can be navigated more easily with IBM's new Cloud Paks for Multi-Cloud Management solution.
